# YOUTUBE’S KPI AND EXPERIMENTATION

I’m going to discuss YouTube. I’ve been using YouTube for over 10 years, and it has been a central part of how I consume content online. Back when I first started using it, YouTube was mainly a platform for watching music videos, tutorials, and funny clips. The design was simple, the algorithm wasn’t as powerful, and I had to search for everything manually.

Over time, YouTube has evolved tremendously. One of the biggest improvements was the personalized recommendation engine — I now discover videos that match my interests without even searching. Features like the “Watch Later” playlist, “Shorts,” and “YouTube Premium” also enhanced my experience. I particularly enjoy the ad-free background play with Premium, and I rely on YouTube both for entertainment and learning. YouTube has effectively become my alternative to traditional television, podcasts, and even university lectures.

## Experiment 1: YouTube Premium + Google One Storage Bundle
### Objective:
To test whether bundling YouTube Premium with Google One (cloud storage) increases Premium conversions among Google account users.

### Null Hypothesis:
Bundling YouTube Premium with Google One does not increase conversion rates compared to offering YouTube Premium alone.

### Alternative Hypothesis:
Users are more likely to subscribe to YouTube Premium when it comes bundled with extra Google One storage.

### Test Cell Allocation:
- Group A (50%): Offered YouTube Premium standalone.
- Group B (50%): Offered a bundle with YouTube Premium + 100GB Google One at a discounted rate.

### Leading Metrics:
- Click-through rate on the subscription offer
- Trial sign-ups

### Lagging Metrics:
- Conversion to paid subscription
- Retention after 3 months

## Experiment 2: “Watch With Friends” Synchronized Viewing Feature
### Objective:
To evaluate whether a new feature allowing users to sync and co-watch videos with friends in real-time increases watch time and daily active users.

### Null Hypothesis:
Introducing the synchronized “Watch With Friends” feature has no impact on watch time or user engagement.

### Alternative Hypothesis:
Users who have access to this feature will show higher watch time and engagement than those who don’t.

### Test Cell Allocation:
- Group A (50%): Access to “Watch With Friends” beta feature.
- Group B (50%): No change (control group).

### Leading Metrics:
- Daily watch time per user
- Frequency of feature usage

### Lagging Metrics:
- Increase in monthly active users
- Retention over 90 days

## Experiment 3: Personalized Shorts Feed Based on Watch History
### Objective:
To test whether curating the Shorts feed based on long-form video history leads to increased Shorts engagement.

### Null Hypothesis:
Personalizing Shorts based on long-form watch history has no effect on Shorts watch time or completion rates.

### Alternative Hypothesis:
Users with a personalized Shorts feed based on their watch history will have higher engagement than those with a generic feed.

### Test Cell Allocation:
- Group A (50%): Generic Shorts feed (current algorithm).
- Group B (50%): Personalized Shorts feed based on prior long-form views.

### Leading Metrics:
- Average Shorts watch time per session
- Number of Shorts watched per session

### Lagging Metrics:
- Increase in total time spent on Shorts over a 30-day period
- User retention among Shorts users
